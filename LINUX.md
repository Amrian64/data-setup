## GitHub account

Have you signed up to GitHub? If not, [do it right away](https://github.com/join).

## Visual Studio Code

### Installation

Let's install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) text editor.

Copy (`Ctrl` + `C`) the commands below then paste them in your terminal (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `v`):

```bash
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y code
```

These commands will ask for your password: type it in.

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type in your password and when you're done, press `Enter`.

### Launching from the terminal

Now let's launch VS Code from **the terminal**:

```bash
code
```

:heavy_check_mark: If a VS Code window has just opened, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**

## Command line tools

### Zsh & Git

Instead of using the default `bash` [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), we will use `zsh`.

We will also use [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), a command line software used for version control.

Let's install them, along with other useful tools:
- Open an **Ubuntu terminal**
- Copy and paste the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl git imagemagick jq unzip vim zsh
```

These commands will ask for your password: type it in.

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type in your password and when you're done, press `Enter`.

### GitHub CLI installation

Let's now install [GitHub official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface). It's a software used to interact with your GitHub account via the command line.

In your terminal, copy-paste the following commands and type in your password if asked:

```bash
sudo apt remove -y gitsome # gh command can conflict with gitsome if already installed
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**


## Chrome - your browser

Install the Google Chrome browser if you haven't got it already and set it as a __default browser__.

Follow the steps for your system from this link :point_right: [Install Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB)

__Why Chrome?__

We recommend to use it as your default browser as it's most compatible with testing or running your code, as well as working with Google Cloud Platform. Another alternative is Firefox, however we don't recommend using other tools like Opera, Internet Explorer or Safari.


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

![Ubuntu terminal with OhMyZsh](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/oh_my_zsh.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If it does, you can continue :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **ask for a teacher**


## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

:warning: **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

gh will ask you few questions:

`What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?` With the arrows, choose `SSH` and press `Enter`. SSH is a protocol to log in using SSH keys instead of the well known username/password pair.

`Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?` Press `Enter` to ask gh to generate the SSH keys for you.

If you already have SSH keys, you will see instead `Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub account?` With the arrows, select your public key file path and press `Enter`.

`Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)`. Type something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. Then press `Enter`.

:warning: When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `Enter`.

You will then get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `Enter`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `Enter` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.



## Dotfiles



Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools. We'll start with a great default configuration provided by [Le Wagon](http://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles), stored on GitHub. As your configuration is personal, you need your own repository storing it, so you first need to fork it to your GitHub account.

:arrow_right: [Click here to **fork**](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/fork) the `lewagon/dotfiles` repository to your account (you'll need to click again on your picture to confirm _where_ you do the fork).

Forking means that it will create a new repo in your GitHub account, identical to the original one. You'll have a new repository on your GitHub account, `your_github_username/dotfiles`. We need to fork because each of you will need to put specific information (e.g. your name) in those
files.


Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

You should see your GitHub username printed. If it's not the case, **stop here** and ask for help.
There seems to be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Time to fork the repo and clone it on your laptop:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

Run the `dotfiles` installer.

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one
at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

Run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email. Be careful
you **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you
don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.
</details>


## Disable SSH passphrase prompt

You don't want to be asked for your passphrase every time you communicate with a distant repository. So, you need to add the plugin `ssh-agent` to `oh my zsh`:

First, open the `.zshrc` file:

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

Then:
- Spot the line starting with `plugins=`
- Add `ssh-agent` at the end of the plugins list

The list should look like:

```bash
plugins=(gitfast last-working-dir common-aliases zsh-syntax-highlighting history-substring-search pyenv ssh-agent)
```

:heavy_check_mark: Save the `.zshrc` file with `Ctrl` + `S` and close your text editor.


## Installing Python (with [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))

Ubuntu comes with an outdated version of Python that we don't want to use. You might already have installed Anaconda or something else to tinker with Python and Data Science packages. All of this does not really matter as we are going to do a professional setup of Python where you'll be able to switch which version you want to use whenever you type `python` in the terminal.

First let's install `pyenv` with the following Terminal command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
exec zsh
```

Ignore the `pyenv: no such command 'virtualenv-init' for now`.

Let's install some [dependencies](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems#prerequisites) needed to build Python from `pyenv`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev \
python3-dev
```

Let's install the [latest stable version of Python](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) supported by Le Wagon's curriculum:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.12
```

This command might take a while, this is perfectly normal. Don't hesitate to help other students seated next to you!

OK once this command is complete, we are going to tell the system to use this version of Python **by default**. This is done with:

```bash
pyenv global 3.8.12
exec zsh
```

To check if this worked, run `python --version`. If you see `3.8.12`, perfect! If not, ask a TA that will help you debug the problem thanks to `pyenv versions` and `type -a python` (`python` should be using the `.pyenv/shims` version first).


## Python Virtual Environment

Before we start installing relevant Python packages, we will isolate the setup for the Bootcamp into a **dedicated** virtual environment. We will use a `pyenv` plugin called [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

First let's install this plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
exec zsh
```

Let's create the virtual environment we are going to use during the whole bootcamp:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.12 simplon
```

Let's now set the virtual environment with:

```bash
pyenv global simplon
```

Great! Anytime we'll install Python package, we'll do it in that environment.


## Python packages

Now that we have a pristine `simplon` virtual environment, it's time to install some packages in it.

First, let's upgrade `pip`, the tool to install Python Packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). In the latest terminal where the virtualenv `simplon` is activated, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then let's install some packages for the first weeks of the program:

``` bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/specs/releases/linux.txt
```


## `jupyter` notebook extensions

Pimp your `jupyter` notebooks with awesome extensions:

```bash
# install nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
jupyter nbextension enable collapsible_headings/main
jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main
jupyter nbextension enable code_prettify/code_prettify
```

### Custom CSS

Improve the display of the [`details` disclosure elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) in your notebooks.

Open `custom/custom.css` in the config directory:
```bash
cd $(jupyter --config-dir)
mkdir -p custom
touch custom/custom.css
code custom/custom.css
```
Edit `custom.css` with:

```css
summary {
    cursor: pointer;
    display:list-item;
}
summary::marker {
    font-size: 1em;
}
```

You can close VS Code.

### `jupyter` check up

Let's reset your terminal:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Now, check you can launch a notebook server on your machine:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser should open on a `jupyter` window:

![jupyter.png](images/jupyter.png)

Click on `New`:

![jupyter_new.png](images/jupyter_new.png)

A tab should open on a new notebook:

![jupyter_notebook.png](images/jupyter_notebook.png)

### `nbextensions` check up

Perform a sanity check for `jupyter notebooks nbextensions`. Click on `Nbextensions`:

![jupyter_nbextensions.png](images/jupyter_nbextensions.png)

Untick _"disable configuration for nbextensions without explicit compatibility"_ then check that _at least_ all `nbextensions` circled in red are enabled:

![nbextensions.png](images/nbextensions.png)

You can close your web browser then terminate the jupyter server with `CTRL` + `C`.


### Python setup check up

Check your Python version with the following commands:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/python_checker.sh)" 3.8.12
```

Run the following command to check if you successfully installed the required packages:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/pip_check.sh)"
```

Now run the following command to check if you can load these packages:
```bash
python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/pip_check.py)"
```

Make sure you can run Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

And open a `Python 3` notebook.

Make sure that you are running the correct python version in the notebook. Open a cell and run :
``` python
import sys; sys.version
```

Here you have it! A complete python virtual env with all the third-party packages you'll need for the whole bootcamp.
